# FEMAP Microbiota Analysis

This repository contains the R scripts used for analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequencing data derived from participants in the FEMAP ACV trial (NCT05022524) - a case-series study investigating the use of a novel delayed-release acetate product to modulate the gut microbiota and mitigate medication-associated metabolic dysfunction in patients with affective disorders on psychotropics.
